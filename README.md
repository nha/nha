### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am @nha, French software developer.

Tech I like: Apache Pulsar, Clojure and the JVM, Node.js and React.

Some of my OSS contributions:

- [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx#contributor-list ) - distributed computing 
- [Yada](https://github.com/juxt/yada#acknowledgments) - asynchronous web server that does HTTP right in my opinion 
- [bid](https://github.com/juxt/bidi#contributing) - bidirectional web routing - an interesting idea that would benefit from more exposure
